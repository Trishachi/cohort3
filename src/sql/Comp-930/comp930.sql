-- Develop a data model for a small application that has at least 3 related tables.
-- You can pick your own but if you canâ€™t think of one consider a customer, invoice, invoice detail, and product tables.
-- Build sample data and load the tables with a small amount of data.
-- The equivalent of 10 customers, each having about 10 invoices and with each invoice having at least 3 items.
-- Spend a few hours considering your options and review with Roman or Larry before you spend much effort on it.
-- Based on the training video build the tables and some sophisticated SQL statements to show the data.
-- The data must be properly normalized.
